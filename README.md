# Craft Memory Game
I dedicate all this code, all my work, to my wife, <br>
who will have to support me and our three children and <br>
the dog once it gets released into the public.

## Getting started

In order to run the game in your browser, you will need `node.js` with `npm` package manager.<br>
You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en). <br>

After the installation, navigate to the root directory with your terminal and run `npm install` command. <br>
It will download all the dependencies (**parcel.js**). <br>
After that please run `npm run start` command in your terminal, which will kickstart the node server on http://localhost:1234 <br>
